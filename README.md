# Door_Lock_System-Atmega32



"Door Locker Security System"

The project is implemented via two AVR atmega32 with 8 MHz internal clock frequency communicating through UART.



The project has two main components:

1- HMI ECU (Human Machine Interface): It is responsible for the interaction with the user to take inputs through keypad and display messages on the LCD.

2- Control ECU: It is responsible for all the processing and decisions in the system like password checking, opening the door using DC Motor and activating the system alarm.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 



Here is the main sequence of the system:

-CREATE A SYSTEM PASSWORD: The user enters a 5-digit password, and the system will check if the password is correctly entered two times.

.

-MAIN OPTIONS: There are two main options (OPEN DOOR , CHANGE PASSWORD) which the user will choose using the keypad.

Open door: The user should enter the password and the control ECU will compare the password with the one in EEPROM and open the door if they matched.

Change password: The user should enter the old password and then create new password if the password matched.

.

-ALARM SYSTEM: if the password entered by the user to open the door or to change password is entered Wrong three times the alarm will activate and shows ERROR on the LCD.

The project is designed and implemented based on the layered architecture model as follow:

.

For HMI_ECU:

-Application layer

-HAL: LCD, KEYPAD

-MCAL: GPIO , UART, TIMER_1

.

For CONTROL_ECU:

-Application layer

-HAL: EEPROM, BUZZER, DC_MOTOR

-MCAL: GPIO , UART, TIMER_1, PWM, I2C
